# Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis using 4 approaches:

1. Using MLX_Intend
2. A recommendation model using tf-idf
3. Implementation of Random Forest using PySpark and Spark MLlib.
4. XGBoost 

* Hosted the MLXIntend model using Docker.
* The model and the README file is included in the folder named LocalHost Application.



**XGBoost seemed to perform the best.**
